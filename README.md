# Big Sur Gnome Shell

## This is a mod inspired by the excellent [**mcOS 11 GTK and Shell theme**](https://www.opendesktop.org/p/1220826/) from **UMAYANGA**

I have made this theme to fix certain issues that I noticed in many of the Gnome Shell themes, when doing the **Big Sur Menu** extension. The problems I found were in the fonts, in the margins and paddings that make **Big Sur Menu** look too big, like the other menus in the **Status Area,** I also noticed that they had eliminated the dividing lines, so I have modified these aspects in order to achieve a clean and well adapted Gnome Shell theme.

## I hope you like this theme and enjoy it.
